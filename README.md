# k8s-insider
A zero-config way to access you kubernetes cluster network

## What
Originally a workaround that got out of hand, k8s-insider is a one-stop-shop for accessing your development kubernetes cluster networked resources. Powered by WireGuard and Rust.

## Features
 - Multiple networks per cluster
 - Dynamic IP assignment
 - Automatic detection of service and pod CIDRs for:
   - Flannel (installed with Helm/CLI)
   - Cilium (installed with Helm/CLI)
 - DNS resolution for pods and services

## Planned features
 - NAT-free routing
 - IPv6 support

## Requirements
 - GNU/Linux:
   - `kubectl` with configured contexts
   - `wireguard-tools` for creating local tunnels
   - `systemd-resolved` for DNS patch functionality
 - Windows:
   - `kubectl` with configured contexts
   - `WireGuard for Windows` for creating local tunnels

## Installation
### `cargo` (GNU/Linux and Windows)
```bash
cargo install --locked k8s-insider
```

### `krew` (GNU/Linux and Windows)
```bash
kubectl krew install insider
```

When installing with `kubectl krew` the app will be accessible through `kubectl insider` command instead of the regular `k8s-insider`.

## Quickstart
```bash
k8s-insider install
k8s-insider create network
k8s-insider connect
```

## Current limitations
Some autodetection functionality might not work properly on single-binary kubernetes distributions (k3s, k0s, etc.). Please feel free to create an issue or submit a PR for these.
